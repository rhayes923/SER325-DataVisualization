# Data Visualization
<b>SER325 Fall 2020 Completed Project</b>

<b>Tim Carta and Ryan Hayes</b>

Data Visualization is a Python application that uses PyMySQL to extract data from a MySQL database hosted on AWS. The extracted data is converted into different visualizations using Matplotlib.

The dataset provides over 16,000 spreadsheet lines of movie data, which includes the movie title, year released, age rating, score on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, the streaming platforms the movie is on, runtime, director(s), languages, genres, and countries available.

The visualizations represent the following:
- Yearly production of movies by streaming platforms
- Movie quality based upon genre
- Movie quality based upon director
- Movies on streaming platforms (Interactive - Allows the user to input a title)
- Movies by rating (Interactive - Allows the user to specify a range of values)
